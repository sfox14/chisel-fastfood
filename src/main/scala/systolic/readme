Linear:
	- experimental implementation of Fastfood
	- linear array of processing elements
	- overlapping datapaths
	- computes the hadamard transform in O(nd) time
	- sequence of computation: bhp => g => h => s => cos ...

hierarchical:
	- full version of Fastfood
	- linear array of processing blocks
	- each block consists of an array of processing elements
	- Hadamard transform computed via FWHT in O(nlogd) time in each block
	- prediction and training
